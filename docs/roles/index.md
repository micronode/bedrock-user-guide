# Bedrock Roles

Bedrock Roles define a clearly-defined collection of fine-grained roles and permissions
for provisioning blueprints.

In addition to the credentials required to access a cloud environment we can optionally specify additional roles to assume when provisioning blueprints.

The benefit of such fine-grained roles is that it provides additional security to ensure a blueprint can make changes outside the scope of the blueprint specification.
