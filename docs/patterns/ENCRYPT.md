# When to use Encryption
This page outlines the need for encryption in modern solution architectures.

## Overview

Encryption of data is necessary to protect sensitive information and operation of secure services. When discussing encryption we usually think in terms of data IN-TRANSIT (e.g. data is moving from one system to another) or data AT-REST (how data is stored or persisted). Both of these concepts are crucial for secure system architectures.
