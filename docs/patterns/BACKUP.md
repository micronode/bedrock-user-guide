# Implementing Backup Strategies
This page provides information on different strategies for backup of critical data and services.

## Overview

Every service or system is fallible, and is prone to go down at some point, so we need to ensure the recovery of a service is both quick and any data loss is minimised. A key aspect of this is a suitable backup strategy that aligns with the target service level objectives (SLOs).

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
TBD.
