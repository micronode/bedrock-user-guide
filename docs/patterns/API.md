# Publishing APIs
This page provides information and reference to approaches for publishing APIs.

## Overview

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide the contract for service interoperability and integration that is a critical component of modern solution architectures.

## REST vs GraphQL

Two common approaches to API design are HTTP Verb-based REST APIs and GraphQL, a modern client-centric approach to query composition. REST is often a good starting point for APIs, as it helps to decompose and consider how data may be isolated from one another. GraphQL in some ways can build on a good REST API by providing a mechanism for combining different data sources together on the server side and reduce chattiness of APIs.

## REST Verbs

TBD.
