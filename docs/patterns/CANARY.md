# Canary Deployments
This page outlines the purpose of canary deployments and why they are important.

## Overview

A canary deployment is typically used to test service changes prior to a full cutover to the new implementation. It may be used to service a small proportion of traffic to ensure no service degradation and provide an option to revert or commit to the new deployment based on empirical testing.

## Blue-green vs Canary Deployments
